# Handwritten Digits Classification

In this project, the effectiveness of five classification-based machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest are evaluated with the aim of identifying the most effective algorithm for classifying [handwritten digits](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html).

## Results

The results reveal that the Support Vector Machine performed best with an accuracy of 98.06%, while the Decision Tree algorithm showed subpar performance with an accuracy of 88.89%.
